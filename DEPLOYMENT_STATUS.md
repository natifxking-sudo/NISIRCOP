- Spatial queries tested and working

## âœ… Services Tested
**User Service (Port 8082) - FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- GET all users: âœ… Working (returns 5 users)

```bash
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=nisircop_secure_password_2024
export JWT_SECRET=$(cat .env | grep JWT_SECRET | cut -d'=' -f2)

# Start services (in separate terminals or use nohup)
cd backend/eureka-server && mvn spring-boot:run
cd backend/api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run  
cd backend/user-service && mvn spring-boot:run
# ... (remaining services)
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Results  
```bash
# User Service GET
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/users
