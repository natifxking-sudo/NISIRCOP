## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Frontend applications need component implementation
- ⚠️ Auth Service needs JWT implementation
- ⚠️ Remaining backend services need implementation
- ⚠️ Integration tests need Docker environment

### Required Fixes
None currently - User Service is production-ready

---

## 📝 Notes

**Working Approach:**
- Treating this as a real production project
- Implementing one service at a time completely
- Writing tests before moving to next service
- Ensuring 100% functionality before considering complete
- No shell scripts - using Java tests and Java-based tools only

**Current Focus:**
Building a fully functional, tested, production-ready system where every component works 100%.
