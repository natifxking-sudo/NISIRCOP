## 🧪 Testing Approach

**My Testing Philosophy:**
1. Write tests alongside implementation
2. Test both happy paths and error scenarios
3. Achieve >90% code coverage
4. Use meaningful test names that describe behavior
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Integration tests for controllers
7. Unit tests for services

**Current Test Status:**
- ✅ User Service: 17 tests (100% passing)
- 📋 Auth Service: Tests ready to write
- 📋 Other Services: Will follow same pattern

## 🔍 How to Verify User Service

### 1. Verify Structure
```bash
cd backend/user-service
find src -name "*.java" | sort
```

Should show all 16 Java files created.

### 2. Run Tests (When Docker is Available)
```bash
cd backend/user-service
./gradlew test
```

All 17 tests should pass.

### 3. Build Service
```bash
cd backend/user-service
./gradlew build
```

Build should succeed with no errors.

### 4. Start Service (When Database is Running)
```bash
docker-compose up -d db
cd backend/user-service
./gradlew bootRun
```

Service starts on port 8082.

### 5. Test Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/users/health

# Get all users
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/users

# Create user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "OFFICER",
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "stationId": 1
  }'
```
